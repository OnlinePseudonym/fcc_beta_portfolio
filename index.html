                                    This was a challenging project for me, I had to completely scrap my JavaScript
                                    when I thought I was almost done and start over fresh. I came accross a bug with
                                    my timer which was being called within a function and creating new scope on each
                                    call so decided to make the game a large class.

                                    opposed to factoring it into smaller parts seem like the wrong way to go about it.
